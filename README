Description : 
First Arduino Project!
The project involved making a working VU Meter. We used both the LM3916 and the Arduino for initial testing, finally decided to make it using the Arduino as it showed a better and faster response to the audio sent in. 
The ADC of the arduino reads in sound variation on a range of 0-1023, this is then mapped onto 10 LED's as shown. This is also then sent via the Serial port and plotted on the laptop using either Matlab or Python.
